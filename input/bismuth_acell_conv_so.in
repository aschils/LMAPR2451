                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond

#Diemac default value ok since Bi is a metal

#Bi is a metal so you should be using a metallic band occupation scheme
occopt 7
#if occopt=4, 5, 6, or 7, the broadening is not based on Fermi-Dirac statistics,
#and tsmear is only a convergence parameter.
#Always check the convergence of the calculation with respect to this parameter,
#and simultaneously, with respect to the sampling of k-points (see nkpt)
tsmear 0.0178

# add to conserve old < 6.7.2 behavior for calculating forces at each SCF step

nspden 1 #no spin magnetisation
