#Definition of the atom types

znucl 83          # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the
                  # possible type(s) of atom. The pseudopotential(s)
                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
                  # to the type(s) of atom.

#Definition of the planewave basis set
ecut 16         # Maximal plane-wave kinetic energy cut-off, in Hartree

#Definition of the SCF procedure
nstep 20          # Maximal number of SCF cycles
toldfe 1.0d-8     # Will stop when, twice in a row, the difference
                  # between two consecutive evaluations of total energy
                  # differ by less than toldfe (in Hartree)
                  # This value is way too large for most realistic studies of materials

#Diemac default value ok since Bi is a metal

#Bi is a metal so you should be using a metallic band occupation scheme
occopt 7
#if occopt=4, 5, 6, or 7, the broadening is not based on Fermi-Dirac statistics,
#and tsmear is only a convergence parameter.
#Always check the convergence of the calculation with respect to this parameter,
#and simultaneously, with respect to the sampling of k-points (see nkpt)
tsmear 0.015

# add to conserve old < 6.7.2 behavior for calculating forces at each SCF step
 optforces 1

#Definition of the k-point grid
kptopt 1
ngkpt 5 5 5       # This is a 5x5x5 grid based on the primitive vectors

################## Determination of the lattice parameters ####################

#optimisation of volume only (do not modify rprim,

#optcell 1

#conduct structural optimization using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
#minimization (BFGS). This is much more efficient for structural optimization
#than viscous damping, when there are less than let's say 10 degrees of freedom
#to optimize.
#ionmov 2

#Gives the number of molecular dynamics time steps or Broyden structural
#optimization steps to be done if ionmovis non-zero.
#ntime 20

#Gives the maximal permitted scaling of the lattice parameters when the cell
#shape and dimension is varied
